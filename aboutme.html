<p style="font-family: 'Jaldi', sans-serif;"> Hi everyone! Welcome to my webpage! If you need a bit of help pronouncing my name its uh-roo-she g-oop-ta. Funny, I know right.</p> 
<p style="font-family: 'Jaldi', sans-serif;"> I come from the beautiful city of Atlanta, GA, but I am originally from the vibrant country- India. Of course I couldn't tell you everything about me on this webpage, so I'll try to keep it short.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Jaldi', sans-serif;">I love school, its weird I know, but I enjoy learning and love the idea that I have the opportunity to recieve an education. I am OBSESSED with coffee, oh my goodness, that stuff makes me so  happy. Since I was little, I had a thing for coffee, and yes I do know it's bad for my health, but hey, you only got one life.  I am in love with stormy days and big cities. I am an asipring New Yorker. Apartments are cozy and big homes are lonely (That's a sentence I hope to live by).If there is one thing in this world that I couldn't live without it'd be my mom or my sister, of course, but an abstract thing would be dancing. I have been dancing since these little feet could walk. Dance has provided me with the confidence I have today and allows me to express myself in a way that words can't. 
<p style="font-family: 'Jaldi', sans-serif;">Beside the things I love, I hate with a burning passion people who think they're entitled. I tend to be strict on the idea of treating others they way you want to be treated. I also strongly dislike lemonade, ripped jeans, strawberry jam, McD's, and cheese (except on burgers).</p> 
<p style="font-family: 'Jaldi', sans-serif;"> I got a lot of hopes and dreams for myself. Living in a big city, wearing classy clothes, traveling a ton, becoming an engineer, and just all around being happy. </p> 
<p style="font-family: 'Jaldi', sans-serif;"> A fun fact about me is that I can do a right split.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Jaldi', sans-serif;"> Check this out! Last week, a friend and I made this game called "Shark Bait." It's a form of a side-scroller game and uses cloning, the core4, and Scratch from MIT. You can click on the link below to click on it </p>
