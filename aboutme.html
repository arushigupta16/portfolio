Hi everyone! Welcome to my webpage! If you need a bit of help pronouncing my name its uh-roo-she g-oop-ta. Funny, I know right.
I come from the beautiful city of Atlanta, GA, but I am originally from the vibrant country- India. Of course I couldn't tell you everything about me on this webpage, so I'll try to keep it short.
I love school, its weird I know, but I enjoy learning and love the idea that I have the opportunity to recieve an education. My faith is something that is also very important to me. I choose to believe in God and I believe through hard work and through faith, I can accomplish anything I set my mind to. I am OBSESSED with coffee, oh my goodness, that stuff makes me so  happy. Since I was little, I had a thing for coffee, and yes I do know it's bad for my health, but hey, you only got one life.  I am in love with stormy days and big cities. I am an asipring New Yorker. Apartments are cozy and big homes are lonely (That's a sentence I hope to live by).If there is one thing in this world that I couldn't live without it'd be my mom or my sister, of course, but an abstract thing would be dancing. I have been dancing since these little feet could walk. Dance has provided me with the confidence I have today and allows me to express myself in a way that words can't. 
Beside the things I love, I hate with a burning passion people who think they're entitled. I tend to be strict on the idea of treating others they way you want to be treated. I also strongly dislike lemonade, ripped jeans, strawberry jam, McD's, and cheese (except on burgers).
I got a lot of hopes and dreams for myself. Living in a big city, wearing classy clothes, traveling a ton, becoming an engineer, and just all around being happy. 
A fun fact about me is that I can do a right split.
